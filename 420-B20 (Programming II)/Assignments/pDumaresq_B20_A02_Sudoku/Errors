Didn't creat loop in main method of SudokuInterface class to loop through the method calls within that class and the SudokuGame 
class. This means that to run either the command line or frame you need to have certain sections of code commented out. Code to
be commented is marked with a 
/*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*/

directly before it. The code as it stands is commented to run the SudokuFrame class.
There's also a weird bug where if you enter an invalid value, then try entering a valid one, it won't update the board.
The undo button makes this bug even worse, I'm not sure where the source of it is. 

Did not get the check box method in the SudokuInterface class working. 

In my spare time I plan on fixing all of these errors so that I can get the extra practise in using these things.
