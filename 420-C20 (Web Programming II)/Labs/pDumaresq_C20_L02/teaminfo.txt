Boston Bruins
	In the Original Six era, the Boston Bruins were the team most affected by World War II as many of their players enlisted.

Chicago Blackhawks
      The Blackhawks won two Stanley Cups in the 1930s and one in 1961. They would not win another until 2010; an almost 50 year gap between championships.

Detroit Red Wings
      The Red Wings were originally called the Detroit Cougars and played their first season in Windsor, Ontario because there was no arena in Detroit.

Montreal Canadiens
      The "Habs" have won more Stanley Cups than any other team winning 24 trophies starting in 1916. However, they have not won the cup since 1993.

New York Rangers
      The Rangers nickname actually came about because they were originally owed by George "Tex" Richard. To differentiate them from the other professional New York team (the Americans) they were nicknamed Tex's Rangers and the name stuck.

Toronto Maple Leafs
      The Maple Leafs did not originally have a name and were called the Blueshirts or the Torontos. This was because of a conflict in the league which almost resulted in the Maple Leafs not surviving.
